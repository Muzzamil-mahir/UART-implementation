# UART Simulation in C++

This cpp code simulates **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)** communication, a protocol for serial data transfer. It demonstrates transmitting and receiving data with features like parity checking, error simulation, and configurable settings.

## Features
- UART transmission and reception simulation.
- Randomized error introduction to simulate real-world conditions.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/uart-simulation.git
   cd uart-simulation

###Sample Output
  ```bash
   Transmitting byte #1 (data: 65)
   TX Bit: 0
   TX Bit: 1
   TX Bit: 0
   ...
   Received data: 65 (0b01000001)
   Reception took 0.0012 seconds.
   
   Parity error detected!
