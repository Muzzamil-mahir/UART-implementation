# UART Simulation in C++

This cpp code simulates **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)** communication, a protocol for serial data transfer. It demonstrates transmitting and receiving data with features like parity checking, error simulation, and configurable settings.

## Features
- UART transmission and reception simulation.
- Randomized error introduction to simulate real-world conditions.
